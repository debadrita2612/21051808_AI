OpenCV is a popular library for computer vision tasks, including image processing and it used for this inheritable algorithm- grounded image generation through the following steps:

Install OpenCV:
Make sure you have OpenCV installed on your system. You can follow the installation instructions for your specific platform. You will need to link your C program with the OpenCV library during  compendium.   

Include OpenCV heads:
Include the necessary OpenCV  title  lines in your code to use OpenCV functions and data structures. 

Display Images:
Use OpenCV functions to load and display images. For case, you can use cv:imread to load an image and cv:imshow to display it. 

Perform Image Manipulation:
You can use OpenCV to perform  colorful image processing tasks,  similar as generating and displaying the stylish places on a oil. To display your generated image,  produce a blank oil using OpenCV, draw places on it, and display it. 

Collect with OpenCV:  
When you  collect your C  law that uses OpenCV, make sure to link it with the OpenCV libraries. The exact  compendium commands may vary depending on your platform and  make system .

Finally, you can implement Genetic Algorithm.
